# Python rocks!

[Exercism](https://exercism.org/) is an open source, not-for-profit project built by people from all backgrounds. With over one hundred dedicated maintainers and thousands of contributors, our goal is to create the best, free, code learning platform on the web.

**This repo contains my progress in the [Python track](https://exercism.org/tracks/python) on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).**

**I strongly encourage everyone to find their own solutions. However, if you're just learning and need a hint, this might help.**

By the way, Exercism frequently updates its exercises. These solutions cover the tests you might find in the folders for this project.

## About Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
